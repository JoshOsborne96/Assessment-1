// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

Planning
Analysis of Requirements
Design
Implementation
Testing & Integration
Maintain

*'Lecture slides say it goes implementation then testing & integration but other sources have those flipped. I went off the class notes.' 


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const Analysis of Requirements = 'This stage is for gathering specific details required for a new system. Research and analysis to determine needs of end-users would be done during this stage. A SRS (software requirment specification) may be created here as well.' 
const Design = 'At this stage, developers will outline all details for the application along with certain aspects like UIs and system interfaces. A design document may be created that can be referenced through the development cycle going foward.'
const Implementation = 'At this stage, the application is integrated into its environment to be eventually installed and be ready for market use'
const Testing & Integration = 'At this stage, developers will sift through their coding to identify any bugs that need to be fixed or tracked. This is done to help created the best experince for the end-user' 
const Maintain = 'Stage where any issues or bugs reported by end-users are addressed and fixed by developers. '
